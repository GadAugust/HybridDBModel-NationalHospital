Each data type specified aims to optimize the databaseâ€™s storage efficiency and query performance, ensuring that the system can handle extensive data inputs and retrievals effectively. The chosen data types reflect the expected format of the data, such as using `VARCHAR` for strings, `INT` for integers, `DECIMAL` for financial amounts, and `DATETIME` for timestamps


Creating a conceptual data model involves outlining the entities, their key attributes, and the relationships between them without specifying data types or detailed schema implementations. This high-level overview is useful for understanding the overall structure and relationships within the database before moving on to more detailed design phases. 

Below is a description of a conceptual data model for the National Hospital case study, which you can use as a guide to create a diagram in Lucidchart or a similar tool:
