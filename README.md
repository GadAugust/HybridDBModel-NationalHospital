# HybridDBModel-NationalHospital
This GitHub repo hosts the data models and docs for a hybrid database model tailored for National Hospital, blending an ER Diagram for operational tasks and a Snowflake Schema for analytics. This setup optimizes daily hospital management and supports strategic data analysis, enhancing efficiency and decision-making capabilities.

### ***Objective Statement:***

The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a dual-purpose data management system for National Hospital. This innovative system will combine an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for managing daily operations with a Snowflake Schema for advanced data analytics. Our objective is to centralize the capture, storage, and retrieval of comprehensive healthcare data, simplifying processes and enhancing efficiency across the hospital's operations. This hybrid approach will not only streamline operational tasks but also bolster the hospital's capabilities in strategic decision-making through improved data analysis. By integrating these two powerful database models, National Hospital will enhance patient care quality and adapt more quickly to changing healthcare needs.

For an effective ER diagram for a National Hospital, it is essential to define not only the entities and relationships but also the appropriate data types for each attribute. This ensures that the database is optimized for performance and accuracy. Here’s a detailed schema of entities along with their attributes, primary keys, and proposed data types:
